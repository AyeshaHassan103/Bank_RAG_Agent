Bank_RAG_Agent
The Bank WhatsApp AI Agent is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)- powered automation system that enables customers to obtain instant answers about banking policies, loans, and services directly through WhatsApp.
This AI Agent acts like a 24/7 virtual banking assistant, capable of understanding both English and Roman Urdu, built using real-world bank data and FAQs.
Real-Life Impact: In Pakistan, customers often wait in long queues or on helplines for simple questions about bank services.
This project removes that friction by bringing verified banking information directly to WhatsApp â€” a platform used by millions daily.
